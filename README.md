# End-to-End Data Analytics Portfolio
End-to-end data analytics portfolio covering ETL pipelines, stakeholder-focused visualisation, and time-series forecasting using Python.

*This portfolio has been adapted for public sharing. Organisation names, platform details, and examples have been generalised to protect confidentiality while preserving analytical methods and outcomes.

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics project using real organisational data, covering the full lifecycle from raw data preparation to predictive insight. The work reflects applied analytics practice in a business context, with a focus on data quality, stakeholder communication, and decision support.

The portfolio showcases how structured data engineering, visual analytics, and forecasting can be combined to improve reporting accuracy, operational efficiency, and strategic planning.

## Project Summary

The portfolio is organised into three standalone projects, each addressing a distinct stage of the analytics lifecycle:

### 🔹 Project 1: Data Integrity & ETL  
**Business problem:** Fragmented, inconsistent data limited trust in reporting and slowed analysis.  

**What I delivered:**  
- Designed a repeatable ETL pipeline to clean, standardise, and integrate multiple datasets  
- Resolved duplication, inconsistent identifiers, and mixed data granularity  
- Applied GDPR-compliant anonymisation and validation checks  
- Created a single, reliable dataset to support reporting and downstream analytics

### 🔹 Project 2: Visual Analytics & Stakeholder Reporting  
**Business problem:** Insights were difficult to interpret quickly, especially for non-technical stakeholders.  

**What I delivered:**  
- Built clear, accessible visual analytics to communicate attendance, demographics, and impact  
- Applied user experience (UX) principles to dashboards and charts  
- Introduced consistent branding and layout for trust and usability  
- Reduced manual reporting effort and improved insight adoption

### 🔹 Project 3: Forecasting & Predictive Insight  
**Business problem:** Planning was reactive, with limited visibility of future demand.  

**What I delivered:**  
- Analysed historical engagement using time series methods  
- Built and evaluated forecasting models (naïve vs regression using RMSE)  
- Identified seasonal patterns and long-term trends  
- Produced forward-looking insights to support proactive planning and resource allocation

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio reflects real-world analytics work rather than synthetic examples.  
It demonstrates my approach to solving ambiguous data problems, building reliable analytical workflows, and translating complex analysis into clear, actionable insight.
