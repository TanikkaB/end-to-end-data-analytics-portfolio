# End-to-End Data Analytics Portfolio
End-to-end data analytics portfolio covering ETL pipelines, stakeholder-focused visualisation, and time-series forecasting using Python.

This repository showcases a three-phase, end-to-end data analytics project completed as part of a Level 4 Data Analyst apprenticeship. The portfolio demonstrates the full analytics lifecycle — from raw data preparation and integrity assurance, through exploratory and visual analytics, to time series forecasting and predictive insight.

The work is based on real organisational data and addresses genuine business challenges around engagement tracking, reporting accuracy, and proactive planning. It evidences technical, ethical, and professional competencies aligned to industry and apprenticeship assessment standards.

## Project Overview

The portfolio is structured into three standalone projects, each building on the previous phase:

### 🔹 Project 1: Data Integrity & ETL  
**Focus:** Data cleaning, standardisation, anonymisation, and integration  
- Designed a repeatable ETL pipeline to consolidate fragmented datasets  
- Addressed duplicated records, inconsistent schemas, and mixed data granularity  
- Implemented GDPR-compliant anonymisation and validation checks  
- Produced a single, reliable source of truth for downstream analysis

📘 Notebook: `01_project1_data_integrity.ipynb`

### 🔹 Project 2: Visual Analytics & User Experience  
**Focus:** Insightful, accessible, stakeholder-ready data visualisation  
- Transformed cleaned data into clear monthly visual insights  
- Applied user experience (UX) principles: consistency, accessibility, usability  
- Built reusable, brand-aligned charts for non-technical stakeholders  
- Enabled faster interpretation of attendance, demographics, and impact

📘 Notebook: `02_project2_visual_analytics.ipynb`

### 🔹 Project 3: Time Series Forecasting & Predictive Analytics  
**Focus:** Forecasting demand to support proactive planning  
- Analysed historical monthly sign-up data  
- Applied time series techniques (decomposition, smoothing, autocorrelation)  
- Built and evaluated forecasting models (naïve vs regression using RMSE)  
- Generated forward-looking insights to inform strategic decision-making

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy)
- Data cleaning, wrangling, and integration
- Relational data concepts and joins
- Descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Data visualisation and storytelling
- User experience (UX) design for analytics
- Ethical data use and GDPR compliance
- Stakeholder-focused communication

---

## Data Ethics & Governance

All analysis was conducted in line with GDPR and ethical data principles.  
Personally identifiable information (PII) was anonymised at ingestion, and only non-sensitive, analysis-ready datasets were used within the notebooks. Outputs focus on aggregated insight rather than individual-level identification.

## How to Use This Repository

Each project notebook is **standalone** and can be run independently:

1. Start with **Project 1** to understand the data preparation and integrity work.
2. Move to **Project 2** to explore visual analytics and UX-driven reporting.
3. Finish with **Project 3** to see forecasting, model evaluation, and predictive insight.

Key visual outputs are saved in each project’s `images/` folder for quick review without running the notebooks.

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio reflects real-world analytics practice rather than toy examples.  
It demonstrates how data analytics can move from operational complexity and fragmentation toward reliable insight, clearer communication, and forward-looking decision support.
