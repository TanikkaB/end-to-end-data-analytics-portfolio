This stage involves importing, cleaning, standardising, and aggregating multiple datasets that currently exist across separate Airtable bases and formats. The aim is to remove duplication, fix inconsistent structures, and build a single, accurate record of each young person’s engagement. This ensures that downstream analytics are based on high-quality, well-organised data, improving efficiency, compliance, and reporting accuracy across the charity."

Each record is described by 140 variables that capture a wide range of details about the participant, their school, and the events they attended. These variables include information such as student/school identifiers, programme details, demographics, school characteristics, regions, free school meal (FSM) status, age, attendance patterns, and additional survey-style responses (e.g., parental background, pronouns, ethnic background, and prior mentoring experience).\n",

Each record captures how a person moves through the engagement funnel (sign-up → eligibility/invite → onboarding → attendance), plus demographics, attribution, and communication preferences. In total there are 61 variables that let you link people to programmes and events, measure participation over time, and understand who you’re reaching and how.\n",

    "- Identifiers & linkage: names, email, Record_ID (Contacts), Record_ID (Sign-ups), cross-table join keys (e.g., Contacts × Sign-ups, Programmes × Att), and dedupe helpers like Unique Name / Unique Event.\n",
    "- Engagement funnel & counts: signed up / eligible & invited / onboarded / attended flags, # Sign-ups, # Onb, # Att, First Time Attendee?, Attended 1< ?, badges/stamps, points, and # FB (feedbacks).\n",
    "- Programme & timing context: Year/Month/Quarter (YY, QQ, “MM# MMM”), start dates, first sign-up created time, SSphere sign-up timestamp, and links back to programmes/events and streams.\n",
    "- Demographics & eligibility: Age Today, Date_of_Birth, UK Region, Ethnicity / Ethnic_Background, and FSM_Eligibility.\n",
    "- Attribution (how they heard): free-text “Where/How did you hear…”, plus channel flags (Social Media, Girlguiding, Schools, Stemettes, Parent/Friend, Other).\n",

    "This table contains hundreds of records, each representing feedback from a young person/student about a specific Stemettes event/programme. The 250 variables associated with each record provide rich metadata linking the response to programmes and people (e.g., Record IDs, dates, streams, seasons), as well as a wide mix of quantitative ratings (often 0–10 scales), qualitative open-text answers, engagement and intention indicators, and baseline vs. post-event uplift measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the variables cover:\n",
    "- Identifiers & linkage: Feedback/Eligibility/Onboarding/Preferences Record IDs, timestamps, programme/event references, contact fields, and de-duplication helpers.\n",
    "- Programme context: Stream, STEAM Season, Year/Quarter/Month, Event Type/Sub-Type, Partner, Target Demographic, Eligible Age Group, modality (physical/virtual).\n",
    "- Participant profile: Age on day/today, age group/stream by age, UK region, contact type, (where present) school name and counts tied to initiatives (e.g., Stemillions).\n",
    "- Experience & content ratings: Multiple /10 scores (experience, enjoyment, content), plus free-text on most/least favourite parts and challenges.\n",
    "- STEAM outcomes (pre/post): Perception, awareness, network, confidence, knowledge—primary flags, improvement indicators, and weighted uplift measures.\n",
    "- Wellbeing & skills: Mental wellbeing, self-confidence, creativity importance/contributors, skills improved, MS Teams difficulty, usefulness of guides.\n",
    "- Intentions & pathways: Pre/post intentions (STEAM/non-STEAM/uncertain), likelihood to consider STEAM, future participation, other opportunities in/outside Stemettes, mentorship follow-ups.\n",
    "- Operational details: Attendance flags (preferences vs. feedback), counts, QR/link helpers, created-by fields, exclusions, resource design/engagement markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these fields let you analyse participant experience and learning, uplift from baseline, who you’re reaching and how, and which formats/streams/partners drive the biggest impact."
